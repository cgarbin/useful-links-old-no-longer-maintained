NativeScript is using the native platform default rendering and layout engine to display the UI of the application. This means that the applications using NativeScript framework are exposing exactly the same UX as natively written applications. The other major difference is that with PhoneGap model you need to write a plugin to access the native capabilities of the platform, while with NativeScript the native APIs are available out of the box.\r\n* Compared to Ionic\r\n   * https://blog.nraboy.com/2015/11/nativescript-vs-ionic-framework-should-you-switch/ \r\n\r\n## Mobile web-base development test\r\n\r\n* http://mobiletest.me/ - specific device testing, paid, 30-day trial\r\n* https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/device-mode - Chrome device emulation mode\r\n* https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/ \r\n* https://validator.w3.org/mobile/ \r\n* http://ready.mobi/ \r\n\r\n## Articles\r\n\r\n* http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/09/rapid-app-development-buzzworthy-spelling-bee-app/\r\n* https://www.airpair.com/javascript/posts/switching-from-ios-to-ionic \r\n\r\n\r\n# Web Development\r\n\t\r\n## General training\r\n\r\n* https://www.udacity.com/courses/web-development \r\n* http://www.frontendhandbook.com/index.html \r\n* https://github.com/maxogden/art-of-node \r\n\r\n## JavaScript\r\n\r\n* Best references\r\n   * Eloquent JavaScript (learning): http://eloquentjavascript.net/ \r\n   * Mozilla: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide\r\n* Quick scripting\r\n   * https://jsfiddle.net/ \r\n   * http://codepen.io/ \r\n* New features in ES6\r\n   * Overview, comparing with ES5: http://es6-features.org/#PromiseCombination \r\n   * Promises: how are they different from callback? \r\n      * Guaranteed execution; chaining; better error handling\r\n      * http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/ \r\n      * http://blog.parse.com/learn/engineering/whats-so-great-about-javascript-promises/ \r\n      * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22539815/arent-promises-just-callbacks \r\n\r\n## CSS\r\n\r\n* Browser support: http://caniuse.com/ \r\n* https://css-tricks.com/\r\n* Mind blowing CSS: https://css-tricks.com/how-i-live-coded-my-most-hearted-codepen-demo/ \r\n* LESS vs. Sass\r\n   * Comprehensive: https://css-tricks.com/sass-vs-less/ \r\n   * Side by side: https://gist.github.com/chriseppstein/674726 \r\n\r\n## HTML5\r\n\r\n* Browser support: http://caniuse.com/ \r\n* Mobile support: http://mobilehtml5.org/ \r\n\r\n## AngularJS\r\n\r\n* Tutorial: https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial \r\n* What is so good in AngularJS?

The idea is that a single fluid design based upon media queries, flexible grids, and responsive images can be used to create a user experience that flexes and changes based on a multitude of factors. The primary benefit is that each user experiences a consistent design. One drawback is a slower load time.\r\n      * Adaptive design is more like the modern definition of progressive enhancement. Instead of one flexible design, adaptive design detects the device and other features, and then provides the appropriate feature and layout based on a predefined set of viewport sizes and other characteristics. This can result in a lack of consistency across platforms and devices, but the load time tends to be faster.\r\n* Progressive enhancement degradation\r\n   * http://www.w3.org/wiki/Graceful_degradation_versus_progressive_enhancement \r\n* Guidelines, patterns\r\n   * http://bradfrost.com/blog/web/responsive-nav-patterns/\r\n      * http://bradfrost.com/blog/web/complex-navigation-patterns-for-responsive-design/\r\n   * http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/01/guidelines-for-responsive-web-design/ \r\n      * Good theory mixed with code\r\n   * https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/layouts/rwd-fundamentals/index?hl=en\r\n      * More direct advice for implementation\r\n      * See also Udacity class referred to in the article\r\n   * http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/overview-of-breakpoints-in-responsive-web-design/\r\n      * Somewhat simple, but good as a short overview of breakpoints\r\n\r\n## Prototyping\r\n\r\n* Invision\r\n   * Supports chat for reviews\r\n   * Will add animation: http://blog.invisionapp.com/motion-prototypeanimation/ \r\n   * Will add styles, can export them: http://blog.invisionapp.com/insight-ui-designers-developers-collaboration /\r\n* Atomic - https://atomic.io/ -- launched Sep/2015\r\n   * Compared to Invision: supports animation and version control\r\n\r\n## Onboardig + teaching marks\r\n\r\n* Submit video to the app store!

The goal is not to help the user make a decision, but to create an ecosystem where a decision is never made—it happens automatically and without user input. The design goal becomes one where we eliminate as many steps as possible and find ways to use data, prior behaviors and business logic to have things happen automatically, or as close to automatic as we can get.\r\n* http://www.fastcodesign.com/3045039/the-next-big-thing-in-design-fewer-choices \r\n* http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/09/anticipatory-design/\r\n\r\n## Design with personas\r\n\r\n* https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/personas\r\n   * See article for some cons as well\r\n* http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/a-closer-look-at-personas-part-1/ \r\n\r\n## Checklist for UX review\r\n\r\n* Who are the target personas or actors?\r\n* How often will they use it?\r\n* What is the mental model of the user?\r\n* What is the context?
